In Python, any line that begins with a hash mark (#) is known as a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter. Comments are intended to allow programmers to communicate with one another (or to remind themselves of what their code does when they sit down with it a few months later). In a larger sense, programs themselves are typically written and formatted in a way that makes it easier for programmers to communicate with one another. Code that is closer to the requirements of the machine is referred to as low-level, whereas code that is closer to natural language is high-level. One of the benefits of using a language like Python is that it is very high level, making it easier for us to communicate with you (at some cost in terms of computational efficiency).
